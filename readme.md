SharpSteer is a C# port of OpenSteer. Like OpenSteer, the aim of SharpSteer is to help construct steering behaviors for autonomous characters in games and animation, with a current implementation focus toward Microsoft's XNA.

Like OpenSteer, SharpSteer provides a XNA-based application which demonstrates predefined steering behaviors. The user can quickly prototype, visualize, annotate and debug new steering behaviors by writing a plug-in for this Demo application.

This fork of SharpSteer includes some changes for neatness of the code, better separation of the demo and the library applications and better use of C# features to make the library easier to use.

### Nuget

SharpSteer2 is [available](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpSteer2/) as a nuget package. Package releases use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### Documentation

The original steering behaviours are documented [here](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1999/gdc99steer.html)
